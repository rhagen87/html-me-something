                    <h2>Combined Syndicates of America</h2>
                    <p>
                        In a fictional "what if Germany won World War I?" scenario, the United States breaks out into a second civil war. The first participant is the military dictatorship of the United States under General Douglas McArthur, who seized power after the radical anarcho-syndicalists won the election of 1936. Then we have the rebelling anarcho-syndicalists as the Combined Syndicates of America, consisting of a union of labor unions in the Rust Belt states. Next we have the American Union State in the south led by Louisiana Senator Huey Long's far-right populist America First Union Party. In the west, we have the Pacific States of America led by the social-democratic Progressive Party. New England is seized and puppeted by Canada, who is still under the dominion of Great Britian.

After victory over the Republic of China, a daring Pacific invasion is mounted against the United States. The JPR goes on to conquer both the Axis and Allied powers.

                    <p>
                        Back to the "what if Germany won WWI?" scenario, we start out as the anarcho-syndicalist Commune of France in 1936. The Empire of Germany attacks the Commune which sparks the Second Weltkrieg, or World War. The Commune pushes back the German invasion and spreads the syndicalist revolution to most of the known world, with the help of her allies in the Third Internationale.

                    <h2>Byzantine Empire</h2>
                    <p>
                        Formerly the Eastern Roman Empire, the Byznatine Empire begins in a precarious situation in 1444. All that remains of the once legendary Roman Empire is the "City of the World's Desire", Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, Turkey) and a few minor Greek provinces. Constantinople had survived through numerous sieges since its foundation in 330, but historically fell to the Ottoman Empire in 1453. Byzantium is one of the most difficult nations to play in this game, as it begins very small with a very powerful, hostile neighbor. But in this alternate history, the Byzantines defeat the Ottomans in their attempt to conquer Constantinople and take back much of the former Roman Empire.
